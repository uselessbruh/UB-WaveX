## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Failed

- Ensure MySQL server is running
- Check credentials in `src/electron/main.js` and `src/python/music_core.py`
- Verify database `ubwavex` exists

### Python Core Not Starting

- Ensure Python is in system PATH
- Check all Python dependencies are installed: `pip install -r src/python/requirements.txt`
- For packaged app, rebuild: `npm run build:python`

### FFmpeg Not Found

- Download FFmpeg from https://ffmpeg.org/
- Extract and add the `bin` folder to system PATH
- Restart terminal/command prompt after adding to PATH

### No Audio Playback

- Check internet connection (for streaming)
- Verify FFmpeg is installed
- Check browser console for errors (Ctrl+Shift+I)

### Search Returns No Results

- Verify internet connection
- Check if YouTube is accessible
- Try different search terms

## Database Schema

### Main Tables

- **tracks** - All music tracks
- **artists** - Artist information
- **albums** - Album information

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Stream URLs cached for 6 hours
- Metadata cached for 30 days
- Cover images cached permanently
- Maximum 5 tracks preloaded in memory

### Database Optimization
